# Consume. Enhance. Replicate.

This is my personal NixOS configuration for my multiple systems, in addition to my setup for home-manager.
The naming conventions are inspired SIVA nanotech from the Rise of Iron DLC from Destiny 1.

Features: 
- Hardware support for specific models like my ThinkpadT480â„¢
- My custom flavors for editor configs, as well as some less nix-like methods of creating dotfiles.
    - The reason for that is I want a config system that can be spliced into other OSes in the event nix isn't an option.

TODO: 
- [ ] Redo some config things- some of the code is a bit messy and needs a touchup.
- [ ] Redo home-manager. It currently doesn't have it's own dedicated file due to some weird issues I was having. I want to fix this later.
- [x] Remove herobrine.

Going forward: Or some better practices I'd like to keep up
- More meaningful commits
- better versioning and stability
